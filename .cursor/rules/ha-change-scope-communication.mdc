# Home Assistant changes: scope + copy/paste communication (required)

When making any change in this repo or in Home Assistant, you MUST clearly state the scope using **one** of the following exact phrases as the first line of the response:

- **Repo YAML Only Updated - You copy paste**
- **Repo YAML & Live HA Updated**

## What to include (always)

Immediately after the scope line, include two bullets:

- **Copy/paste required**: list the exact file path(s) the user should copy/paste into the HA UI (usually `cards/**` YAML).
- **Reference only (repo)**: list any YAML files added/updated that are kept in git for review/backups (usually `automations/**`, `scripts/**`).

If **Live HA** was updated, also include:

- **Live HA entities updated**: list entity_id(s) created/updated/disabled (helpers, automations, scripts) so the user can verify in UI and traces.

## Never ambiguous

- Do **not** imply HA was updated unless you actually updated it via tools.
- If you only changed repo YAML and plan to update HA later, say so explicitly and stop.
