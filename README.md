# Home Assistant YAML Sandbox

This repo was created becuase I stopped managing my YAML configs for Home Assistant directly and trusted the UI to keep all that in order.

But then Cursor happened. And now I want at least some automations / scenes / cards / sensors YAML in the same repo so it can be used as context to spin up others. 

Right now I am just copy pasting into this repo Home Assistant, iterating on things, then saving back into Home Assistant via it's YAML editor UI. This feels pretty good so far because I don't need to worry about screwing too much up but it's obviously flawed in how quickly things can get out of sync. Longer term I may write a script that pulls certain things from my /config folder into here.
